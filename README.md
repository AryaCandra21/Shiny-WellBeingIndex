# Shiny-WellBeingIndex

Experienced in data visualization and R programming, I've crafted a concise dashboard presenting a Well-Being Index for Indonesia ðŸ™Œ. Rooted in OECD's framework and Canadian methodologies, it offers 10 equally weighted domains, reflecting diverse aspects of well-being. Tailored to Indonesian data, this user-friendly dashboard provides clear insights for informed decision-making ðŸŽ¯.
